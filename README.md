# Network Visualisation using Phyton

This directory contains the codes, images, cytoscape files and datasets for visualising multiple different networks.

## The uploaded files

The datasets folder contains the data for all the networks and the newly generated nodes and edges for the different random network models. \
The images folder contains all the images generated during the modelling and simulations. \
The graph_tool.ipynb contains visualisations for the block model using graph-tool. \

## The main code contains the followings:

1: Importing the different data sets \
2: Calculating centralities \
3: Calculating different communities \
4: Stochastic Block Model \
5: Comparison to random networks - Erdos-Renyi and Configuration Model \
6: Assortativity and Dissortativity
