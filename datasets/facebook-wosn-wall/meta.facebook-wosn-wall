long-description:  The is the directed network of a small subset of posts to other user's wall on Facebook.  The nodes of the network are Facebook users, and each directed edge represents one post, linking the users writing a post to the users whose wall the post is written on.  Since users may write multiple posts on a wall, the network allows multiple edges connecting a single node pair.  Since users may write on their own wall, the network contains loops.
