This data is the original data used for the Nature Genetics paper titled:
"Network motifs in the transcriptional regulation network of Escherichia coli"
S S SHEN-ORR, R MILO, S MANGAN & U ALON, Nature Genetics Volume 31 No. 1 pp 64 - 68.

The files in this directory include:

Fig4.pdf - The supplementary figure from the above mentioned paper.

regInterFullFiltered.htm - A listing of all the interactions in the data in an HTML table.

coliInterFullVec.txt - All interactions in the dataset listed as a three column vector ( operon number, transcription factor number,regulation type (1 activator, 2 repressor, 3 dual). 

coliInterNoAutoRegVec.txt - A binary (unsigned) version of coliInterFullVec only without autoregulation interactions.

coliInterFullNames.txt - A two column vector, the first column is a number, matching the number of the first two columns of the above interaction files, and the second column is the name of the operon.

There are 577 interactions in the matrix (519 with no autoregulation).
